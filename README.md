###### AxonCore

A full featured framework built around the [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) library.
It's purpose is to make creating bots simpler, cleaner and faster.
Aimed more towards developers, it is especially a viable solution if you need a robust bot with a database.

AxonCore is the core of EASE. It uses a slightly modified version to better serve its functions.
